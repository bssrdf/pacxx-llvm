                    The Region Vectorizer (LLVM 4.0 version)

Compiler Design Lab / Saarland University / Saarland Informatics Campus


The Region Vectorizer (RV) is a general-purpose vectorization framework for LLVM.
RV provides a unified interface to vectorize code regions, such as inner and outer loops, up to whole functions.
We had a poster on RV at the 2016 US LLVM Developers' Meeting (docs/poster_rv.pdf).
RV is largely based on the Whole-Function Vectorizer by Ralf Karrenberg (http://www.cdl.uni-saarland.de/projects/wfv/).

For any questions, please get in touch with Simon Moll (moll@cs.uni-saarland.de).


-- Prerequesites --
LLVM 4.0
Clang (for the vector math libraries)

-- Buildling libRV --
RV is an LLVM tool and integrates into the LLVM build system.
Clone this repository into llvm/tools/rv where llvm is your LLVM source directory. RV will build along with LLVM.

-- Testing libRV --
After building rv with LLVM copy bin/rvTool from the LLVM build directory to rv/bin/rvTool in the rv source directory.
To run the entire test suite enter the folder test/ and run ./test_rv.py.
More details on testing can be found in test/README

-- Getting started with the API --
Users of RV should include its main header file include/rv/rv.h and supporting headers in include/rv.
The command line tester (tool/rvTool.cpp) is a good starting point to learn how to use RVs API.
